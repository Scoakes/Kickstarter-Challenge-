# Kickstarter-Challenge-

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

	Louise is interested in putting on a production; to do this they will need to raise funds. Before beginning she wants to know that how past fundraising campaigns faired based on their launch date and fundraising goal. To help her we will visualize the data in the Kickstarter Excel file based on those parameters.  

### Purpose
	
	The purpose of this exercise is to help Louise see trends in the Kickstarter data so that she will be able to make an informed decision on the best goal and launch date to ensure success. 

## Analysis and Challenges

	This challenge I found to be straight forward, and I would’ve likely finished it verry quickly if I had followed rule number one and explored the data before jumping into each challenge. When I began challenge two, I got stuck on calculating the number of canceled Kickstarters. I kept coming up with zero down the entire column, something I thought was due to an error. If I had taken a minute to look at the data beforehand, I would’ve known that my first calculations were correct and not spun my wheels for 30 minutes. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

	 

	This is a good visualization of when not to start a Kickstarter campaign. Looking at Kickstarter failures, the months of Mar, Apr, Jun and Dec had the highest instances of failure, suggesting these are not the best months to begin a campaign. Additionally, we see a large proportion of campaigns are started in the month of Aug are canceled, perhaps due to a low donations as the end of the year and holiday season that follow. After analyzing when not to begin a campaign, it makes it easier to determine more ideal launch dates. From the visualization above it appears that Jan, May and Sep would all be good choices.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

	 

	You may expect there to be a linear correlation between goal amount and success rate, the smaller the goal the easier it is to achieve. We see that is initially the case, however, at the $15,000-$19,999 mark we see a shift where the failure rate is higher than the success rate. The success rate does not rise above the failure rate for the remaining dollar amounts except for the $35,000-39,999 bucket where we see a jump to 67% success rate.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

	The months of Mar, Apr, Jun and Dec are the least favorable months to begin a campaign. The months of Jan, May and Sep are the most favorable months to begin a campaign.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	
	The most ideal goal amount would be between $35,000-39,999 due to its high success rate and funding amount.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	
	We didn’t filter any of the outcomes based on year, we only looked at the entire data set. There may have been some outlier in a particular year that led to skewed results.
	

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	
	I would like to look at how the Country where the Kickstarter originated affected the outcome as well as the amount raised. Additionally, we could look at how the goal affected the amount raised, perhaps setting the bar high led to increased donations or maybe a large goal deterred contributors.
